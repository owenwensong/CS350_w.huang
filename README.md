CS350 Advanced Computer Graphics II

Use as a reference only!<br />
This project uses my vulkan graphics engine: MTEngine.<br />
MTEngine was originally written for CSD2150 (Introduction to Real-Time Rendering), with C++20, requiring Vulkan 1.2 and above.<br />
MTEngine has been modified to require only Vulkan 1.1 and above on the target platform's Graphics Drivers.<br />
MTEngine has been downgraded from C++20 to C++17 or above to facilitate building on the lab machines in the Redmond campus.<br />
